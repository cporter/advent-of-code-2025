# Advent of Code

This started out as 2025, but I think I'm just going to do all
of AOC in C++ from here on out. Why not. Use the daily driver.

Some of these programs require system -dev libraries. Off the
top of my head, it's

* `libz3-dev` for 2025 day 10
* `libssl-dev` for 2015 day ... the one that wants MD5.

So, you know, install on your own in the usual way.
